# ASP.NET MVC Framework

## Advantages:
•	Separation of concerns. The application is divided into Model, View, Controller.
•	Though there is a lot of overhead in the beginning, an MVC application is more easily to maintain in the future.  
•	Has a built-in unit tester.
•	Supports mobile friendly frameworks such as bootstrap.
•	Entity Framework integrates and connects rather easily to a MSSQL database.
•	Integrates nicely with Active Directory.
## Disadvantages: 
•	No “visual” aspect. It’s not like visual C# where we can drag and drop and preview the application. The application has to be run every time we want to see our changes.
•	Using the MVC design pattern comes with the overhead of making sure our application conforms to that design pattern and learning that design pattern.
•	Scaffolding (Visual Studio auto generates code) is a neat idea but I’ve ran into issues with it in the past. Though I was able to resolve these issues it wasn’t just a “quick fix” and usually took 10-30 minutes with each issue.
