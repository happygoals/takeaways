## User Results
* Users use interfaces to accomplish tasks
* The first step of the design process is to understand how users are completing the task NOW
### Designer Techniques
* Discover what the user is doing now 
  - Naturalistic observation, servey, focus group, interview
* Present out requirements gathering(RG) findings

### Critical Note: 
* The qualitative and quantitative data in the appropriate manner

### Techniques to communicate RG findings
* About the User
  1. Descriptive statistics
    - Range
    - Mean
    - Median
  2. User Characteristics tables
  3. Personas
## Presenting Task Findings
### Pitfall Averted!
* Techniques to understand how the user is currently accomplishing the task
* Collected data via naturalistic observation, survey, focus group, interview that have given you what the user currently does

### Techniques to present Require Gathering (RG) findings 
* About the Task : These techniques describe the data beyond descriptive statistics.
  1. Scenarios
  2. Essential Use case
  3. Hierarchical Task Analyses
  4. Current UI Critique
  
* Critical Note: The qualitative and quantitative data are analyzed appropriately. 

## Scenarios 
* Scenarios provide a narrative of both the <b>qualitative</b> and <b>quantitative</b> data.
* It allows us an opportunity to <b>convey the richness of the data set we collected in a storyline</b> that highlights all of the important aspects about the task and how it is currently accomplished. 
* It allows the task to <b>come to life</b>, beyond the graphs and tables that present cold hard statistics. 
* Make a list of questions that the designer asks in order to get the narrative. 
* It allows us to understand how a system is used by the user. 

## Essential Use Case Scenario
* Essential Use Case Scenario allows us to understand the users's activities, and what the system requirements are. 
* Three important elements
1. Users' Goals
  - What aspect of X this captures. 
2. User Intention
  - The series of steps the user needs to enter into the system.
3. System's Responsibilities
  - What the system must do after each step completed by the user. 
  
 ## Hierarchical Task Analyses
 * Hierarchical Task Analyses allow us to consider how users are currently completing a task. 
 * It is all about the users goals. 
 * User and the steps to accomplish the goals.
  - Start with the goal, and number each of the major steps towards meeting the goal. 
  - Some of the steps have substeps that I must fulfill before going on the next step. 
  
  ## Current UI Critique
  * Subjects: Mobile apps, Websites, or a set of paper forms that the user currently uses.
  1. What task is it used for?
   - Interact with UI. 
   - Take UI for a spin so to speak 
   - If each UI for each UI, you would want to identify the task or task of the users uses it for.
  2. Clicks to complete task
   - An <b>objective</b> measure of performance (How long it takes to complete the task). 
  3. What does it well?
   - You could use either <b>objective</b> or <b>subjective</b> measures. 
   - Articulate where the needs are being met. 
  4. How could it be improved? 
   - Systematically analyzing the interfaces that are currently being used. 
   - What can you do to improve the user experience?
   - We want to improve the user experience but this requires that we know what the user is already enjoying and build on that.
