## Overview 
## Types of Users and Types of Data
## Discovery Technique Overview

## Naturalistic Observation
### Goal 
 * To watch the users in action in their own environment
 * The designer goes out to where the task takes place and observes the user.
 * Field technique: We want to get a sense of the environment where the task takes place (in the field).
 * Least interaction technique: In most cases, there is no interaction between the designer and the user.
 * The designer must have a plan for the observation session.
 - Discover what the user is doing now
 - Review Module of interacton with users
### Data Gathered (Kinds of Data we can gather)
 #### Naturalistic Observation Data : Platform for future study 
 * Qualitative : A set of notes written by the designer as he observes the user.
 * Quantitative : A set of counts for events the designer expects to see. It can be collected during a naturalistic observation session as well.
  e.g. If a secondary stakeholder is expected to be in the field as well, we may have to keep track of how many times these two users interact.
### Advantages and shortcomings 
 #### Advantages 
 * No direct interaction with user 
 - Able to see what the user is doing directly, collect data anywhere and at any time
 * NO social desirability 
- The user is simply engaging in their normal behavior. They're not changing it based on what they expect the designer might ask or might want.
 #### shortcomings
 * Observer Bias may lead to incorrect notes 
 - The designers' data are limited to his or her own collection technique and interpretation. 
 - This is the main reason why naturalistic observations are usually first steps in the requirements gathering process.
 * No feedback from user 
 - Good design involves interaction with the user.
 #### Ethical Consideration
* Maintain anonymity of users (safeguard the privacy of the individual)
* Cannot collect identifying information without asking user permission
### Naturalistic Observation in Iterative Data Gathering Process
* To conduct the technique that provides us with the information we need
![Iterative Data Gathering Process](/assets/images/UXD-Iterative data gathering process_2020-06-16.jpg)
* We can take the qualitative data from this Naturalistic Observation session.
* We can come up with a set of questions to ask during a direct interaction with the user.
* We can develop a survey where we find out in the Naturalistic Observation session.
* We can host a focus group or do a set of interviews to further clarify the findings from the survey data.
