## Overview 
## Types of Users and Types of Data
### Qualitative
### Quantitative
## Discovery Technique Overview

## Naturalistic Observation
### Goal 
* To watch the users in action in their own environment
* The designer goes out to where the task takes place and observes the user.
* Field technique: We want to get a sense of the environment where the task takes place (in the field).
* Least interaction technique: In most cases, there is no interaction between the designer and the user.
* The designer must have a plan for the observation session.
    - Discover what the user is doing now
    - Review Module of interacton with users

### Data Gathered (Kinds of Data we can gather)
#### Naturalistic Observation Data : Platform for future study 
* Qualitative : A set of notes written by the designer as he observes the user.
* Quantitative : A set of counts for events the designer expects to see. It can be collected during a naturalistic observation session as well.
    - e.g. If a secondary stakeholder is expected to be in the field as well, we may have to keep track of how many times these two users interact.

### Advantages and Shortcomings 
#### Advantages 
* No direct interaction with user 
    - Able to see what the user is doing directly, collect data anywhere and at any time
* No social desirability 
    - The user is simply engaging in their normal behavior. They're not changing it based on what they expect the designer might ask or might want.
#### Shortcomings
* Observer Bias may lead to incorrect notes 
    - The designers' data are limited to his or her own collection technique and interpretation. 
    - This is the main reason why naturalistic observations are usually first steps in the requirements gathering process.
* No feedback from user 
    - Good design involves interaction with the user.
#### Ethical Consideration
* Maintain anonymity of users (safeguard the privacy of the individual)
* Cannot collect identifying information without asking user permission

### Naturalistic Observation in Iterative Data Gathering Process
![Iterative Data Gathering Process](/assets/images/UXD-Iterative_data_gathering_process_2020-06-16.jpg)
* To conduct the technique that provides us with the information we need
* We can take the qualitative data from this Naturalistic Observation session.
* We can come up with a set of questions to ask during a direct interaction with the user.
* We can develop a survey where we find out in the Naturalistic Observation session.
* We can host a focus group or do a set of interviews to further clarify the findings from the survey data.

## Survey
### Goal 
* Survey: A set of questions ( = Questionnaire) 
* To get the users' opinions (Behavior, perceptions, attitudes and feelings, and opinion about someone else)
* Field/Lab technique: Surveys can take place in the field or the lab (Walk, home, call).
* Little interaction technique: Sheet of paper, completely digital like kiosk or website
* The quality of the data will be directly related to how well you prepare.

### Data Gathered
#### Survey Data : Platform for future study 
* Qualitative : Closed ended questions 
    - Ordered response: Dichotomous response(Yes or now), Likert scales(How much you like, One to Five), Rank (Listed from the most to the least preferred)
    - Unrdered response: The user with questions that don't have a logical order. Lists, Demographic questionnaires, etc.
* Quantitative : Open ended questions 
    - Goal: To get brief answers from the user about their opinions, preferences, attitudes in a couple of sentences. 

### Advantages and Shortcomings
#### Advantages
* Efficient data collection 
    - Collect data from a number of individuals simultaneously.
* Relatively easy data analyses 
#### Shortcomings
* Superficial knowledge 
    - Not provide us with insight into the problem area or what we want to design.
* Recall bias
    - Users' recollections are incorrect or inaccurate.
* Social desirability bias
    - Responses that pleases the researcher
* Sample bias
    - Users that chose to participate may not represent the users we couldn't reach or that didn't want to participate.

### Survey in Iterative Data Gathering Process
* To lead us to use other techniques
* To indicate that there are these three prominent ways the user completes a task
* We can then organize a focus group to try to understand what is driving these preferences.
* e.g. We could just as easily decide that in fact, following the survey we would like to do a naturalistic observation where we observe males and we observe females engaging in the task.

## Focus Groups
### Goal
* To engage users in direct conversations
* Room technique: Focus groups take place in a controlled environment, usually a room where users can feel free to share and discuss information in a private setting.
* A high degree of interaction technique
* Composition
    - User : Between 5-10 users who represent the group that the designer want to address
    - Design team : Trained moderator, Note taker, Media person(Audio tapes or video tapes - optional)
* Structure
    - Schedule : 1 hour = 5 minute warm up + 5 minute creative exercise + 45 minute discussion(3topics) + 5 minute wrap up 

### Data Gathered
* Qualitative : A set of notes written by the note taker, Transcribed data (An entire focus group session transcripts and analysis of that session) 
* Quantitative : A data gathered at the begining of the focus group. 
    - e.g. Demographic information about the users, Initial survey information about the attitudes and opinions on the topic of interest

### Advantages and Shortcomings
#### Advantages
* Rich data in a timely manner
* Group dynamic inspires
* Good for the one who does not want an one-to-one session
#### Shortcomings
* Need a team headed by an experienced moderator to optimize the data that is collected.
* Social influence may lead to group think. 
* Influential member (Echoing or status or other social desirability factor)

### Focus groups in Iterative Data Gathering Process
* Focus group = The culmination of the design process (because of the rich data)
* The designer may want to interview other users to get information from interesting themes that arose during the focus group.
* We could just as easily have developed an interview following the focus group to conduct the technique that provides us with the information we need.

## Interview
### Goal
* To gather indepth information from a user
* Private place technique : Interview can take place either in the field or in the lab which is enough privacy that the user can freely answer the questions being asked.
* Most interaction technique : The interview offers the designer an opportunity to have a conversation with the user and the interviewer can then follow any interesting lead the user can have.

### Data Gathered 
#### Interview Data: Mostly be qualitative
* Qualitative : Designer's handwritten notes, Systematic analysis from the inteview transcript
* Quantitative : A data gathered at the begining of the focus group. (form of a short survey)
    - e.g. Demographic information about the users, Initial survey information about the attitudes and opinions on the topic of interest

### Advantages and Shortcomings
#### Advantages
* In depth (One on one) conversation
* Flexible protocol for the interview so that the designer can choose to ask followup questions that weren't on the protocol
#### Shortcomings
* Skilled interviewer : Lead agenda and manage and build rapport(honest opinions, not favorable responses)
* More time intensive process : For data collection and analyses, we are spending a lot of time on one person.

### Focus groups in Iterative Data Gathering Process
* Interviews are most useful when they are a culmination of the data gathering strategy.
* When the problem faced in the requirements gathering process was well understood and what was needed was some final clarifications or insights from the user by interview.
