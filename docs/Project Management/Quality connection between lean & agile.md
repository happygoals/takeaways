# Quality connection between lean & agile

 ## QUALITY is built-in into the Product, acknowledging that quality cannot be simply added to a Product
after it has been built. Lean and agile give opportunities to inspect it often. 


- Production	
  - Lean methodology produces products in small lots.
  - Agile methodology provides small frequent versions of the product in iterations
- Quality
  - Lean: processes should be inspected constantly and improved upon
  - Agile: regular checks, sprint review meetings, and daily scrum meetings, to evaluate the project for improvements



* If the quality of the product is bad, reworking and refactoring as a developer.  Lean helps product quality better.
