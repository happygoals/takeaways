## Advantages of completing one project before another
  - Consider the goals and objectives of the company
  - Can apply a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to decide which projects to do. 
  - Strategies for evaluating potential projects include
        - Risk Mitigation: taking steps to reduce or prevent risks
        - Planning and scheduling: When projects will be completed
        - Resource management: does the business have technical skill and ect to complete project
        - Financial Management: does the company have the funds to complete this project?
        - Determining return on investment (ROI): will this project make the company money
        - Project prioritization: deciding which order the company will take on projects

Q1. Can Big Mike’s afford all 4?

“If we are going to survive, we need to figure out how to engage in grower customer based. So we all can have a scanning systems that delivers.” Because why does the scanning system matter, we don’t have a customer deliver too. 

Q2. Are all 4 projects still relevant? YES
The problem is how relevant are they to be able to invest it! 

You are all the steering committee, you are share hold this your company. 

Force ranking & Dependency coaching

Dependency coaching answer: SOX, Scanning, Import, Loyalty 

You have money you don’t know about. Some of them can just not become relevant. 
Your order has changed. So that means I can say 2 project can move on. 

Q3. (Second rank) pick one
Second pick: Loyalty // The loyalty program may bring in other that data main structure reveals something different. 

**The lesson in this debate: I validate my hypothesis. You walked in pretty soon and had a consensus on what was rank force
Information, true questions, you actually divided, but the majority of individuals in the room picked one. And you will almost always have that one executive that yields in a steer in a border.
