# Risk Mitigation

<b> What is Risk Management? </b>

Project risk management is the art and science of identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk throughout the life of a project and in the best interests of meeting project objectives. 
Risk management can have a positive impact on selecting projects, determining their scope, and developing realistic schedules and cost estimates.
Project risk management involves understanding potential problems that might occur on the project and how they might impede project success.

However, some risks can be positive and are known as opportunities.
- Risk management is an investment, so costs are associated with it.
- It depends on the nature of the project.
- Cost should not exceed the initial benefits.
- Organizations can have a risk-seeking nature, some can have a neutral tolerance for it, and some have an aversion to it. - - These are part of the utility theory of risk.
* The goal of project risk management can be viewed as minimizing potential negative risks while maximizing potential positive risks.

## 6 major processes:
1) Planning risk management Involves deciding how to approach and plan risk management activities for the project. By reviewing the project management plan, project charter, stakeholder register, enterprise environmental factors, and organizational process assets, project teams can discuss and analyze risk management activities for their particular projects. The main output of this process is a risk management plan.
2) Identifying risks involves determining which risks are likely to affect a project and documenting the characteristics of each. The main output of this process is the start of a risk register, which you will learn about later in this chapter.
Performing qualitative risk analysis involves prioritizing risks based on their probability of occurrence and impact. After identifying risks, project teams can use various tools and techniques to rank risks and update information in the risk register. The main outputs are project documents updates.
3) Performing quantitative risk analysis involves numerically estimating the effects of risks on project objectives. The main outputs of this process are project document updates.
Planning risk responses involves taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to meeting project objectives. 
4) Using outputs from the preceding risk management processes, project teams can develop risk response strategies that often result in updates to the project management plan and other project documents.
5) Controlling risk involves monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, carrying out risk response plans, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project. The main outputs of this process include work performance information, change requests, and updates to the project management plan, other project documents, and organizational process assets.

## Topics included in the risk management plan:
- Methodology
- Roles and responsibilities
- Budget and Schedule
- Risk Categories
- Risk probability and impact
- Stakeholders’ tolerances
- Tracking 
- Risk documentation


Many projects also include contingency plans, fallback plans, contingency reserves, and management reserves.
Contingency plans are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs. For example, if the project team knows that a new release of a software package may not be available in time to use for the project, the team might have a contingency plan to use the existing, older version of the software. 

Fallback plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk do not work. For example, a new college graduate might have a main plan and several contingency plans for where to live after graduation, but if these plans do not work out, a fallback plan might be to live at home for a while. Sometimes the terms contingency plan and fallback plan are used interchangeably. 

Contingency reserves or contingency allowances are funds included in the cost baseline that can be used to mitigate cost or schedule overruns if known risks occur. For example, if a project appears to be off course because the staff is not experienced with new technology and the team had identified that as a risk, the contingency reserves could be used to hire an outside consultant to train and advise the project staff in using the new technology. 

Management reserves are funds held for unknown risks that are used for management control purposes. They are not part of the cost baseline, but they are part of the project budget and funding requirements. If the management reserves are used for unforeseen work, they are added to the cost baseline after the change is approved.

## Risk Categories:
1) Market risk: If the IT project will create a new product or service, will it be useful to the organization or marketable to others? Will users accept and use the product or service? Will someone else create a better product or service faster, making the project a waste of time and money?
2) Financial risk: Can the organization afford to undertake the project? How confident are stakeholders in the financial projections? Will the project meet NPV, ROI, and payback estimates? If not, can the organization afford to continue the project? Is this project the best way to use the organization’s financial resources?
3) Technology risk: Is the project technically feasible? Will it use mature, leading-edge, or bleeding-edge technologies? When will decisions be made on which technology to use? Will hardware, software, and networks function properly? Will the technology be available in time to meet project objectives? Could technology be obsolete before a useful product can be created? You can also break down the technology risk category into hardware, software,and network technology if desired.
4) People risk: Does the organization have people with appropriate skills to complete the project successfully? If not, can the organization find such people? Do people have the proper managerial and technical skills? Do they have enough experience? Does senior management support the project? Is there a project champion? Is the organization familiar with the sponsor or customer for the project? How good is the relationship with the sponsor or customer?
5) Structure/process risk: What degree of change will the new project introduce into user areas and business procedures? How many distinct user groups does the project need to satisfy? With how many other systems does the new project or system need to interact? Does the organization have processes in place to complete the project successfully?
