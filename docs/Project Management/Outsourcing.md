# Outsourcing

## Pros: 
* Clients can focus on core competencies
* Faster ramp-up time or time to market
* A fresh look from an outside view
* A vendor can ensure that best practices are followed and can provide the latest trends in specific sectors
* Preparation for similar projects in the future.

## Cons: 
* Commitment (buy-in) and resources required internally, even though external resources are used
* Relationship with vendor needs to be managed otherwise no benefits are accrued
* Because ownership of resources does not exist with the client, the vendor can discontinue the relationship
* Depending on the nature of the project, data security may be compromised
* May cost more if the relationship does not work out.
