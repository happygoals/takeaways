### 

90% of project management includes a form of communication
Communication & collaboration (as all of you are learning from the course project) can make or fail a project.
Tools & Technique for communication & collaboration need to well understood and examples of where communication falls short can impact outcomes. 
Ultimately, if a team is not delivering, it is less important that the team has great communication & collaboration.



Engage with non-communicative person on a project: 
Identify where the communication breakdowns occur, why not responsive, try to work with them. Reach out, partner up. 
Conflict resolution approach, may even be a technology problem or misunderstanding. Reach out and try to help, don't accuse.
