## Liberating structures are alternative frameworks for common meetings/conversations 
E.g. presentations, managed discussions, status reports, open discussions, brainstorms
These can be found (surprisingly) at LiberatingStructures.com. 

## Goals of Liberating Structures
- To liberate us from the baggage and/or constraints associated with meetings.
- To engage people
- To contribute for everyone
- To brainstorm
- To speak curiosity and innovation 
c.f. It does not have to be a project manager to use. 

## Specific examples mentioned in class:
* TRIZ
* What3 Debrief
