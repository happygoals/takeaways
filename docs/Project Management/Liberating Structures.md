## Liberating structures are alternative frameworks(exercises) for common meetings/conversations 
E.g. presentations, managed discussions, status reports, open discussions, brainstorms
These can be found (surprisingly) at LiberatingStructures.com. 

Changing the way we conduct a meeting can enable us to consider different perspectives, to better grasp ideas that may have otherwise been misinterpreted or disregarded based on conversational or contextual constraints (consider the difference between what you mean, what you say, and how other people interpret what you say), or to come up with entirely new ideas.

## Goals of Liberating Structures
- To liberate us from the baggage and/or constraints associated with meetings.
  - We all have certain ideas about how business should be conducted - especially in the context of meetings and presentations, or how we interact with superiors, subordinates, and team members in a work environment. These ideas are socialized, learned from social and business culture.
- To engage people
- To contribute for everyone
- To brainstorm
- To speak curiosity and innovation 
- To help us express ourselves outside of these self-imposed constraints. 
c.f. It does not have to be a project manager to use.
