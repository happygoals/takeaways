### Liberating structures are alternative frameworks for common meetings/conversations 
E.g. presentations, managed discussions, status reports, open discussions, brainstorms
that aim to liberate us from the baggage and/or constraints associated with those meetings.

These can be found (surprisingly) at LiberatingStructures.com. 

** Specific examples mentioned in class:
* TRIZ
* What3 Debrief
* 1-2-4 Rapid Conversation

Are to engage. A way for everyone to contribute.
Do not have to be a project manager to use, great for brainstorming, sparking curiosity and innovation.
