[November 4 & 6, 2019] [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/)


## Liberating structures are alternative frameworks(exercises) for common meetings/conversations
-  An alternative way to approach and design how people work together
-  It provides a menu of thirty-three Liberating Structures to replace or complement conventional practices.
 - Examples of conventional practices: presentations, managed discussions, status reports, open discussions, brainstorms
    These can be found (surprisingly) at LiberatingStructures.com. 

- Changing the way we conduct a meeting can enable us to consider different perspectives, to better grasp ideas that may have otherwise been misinterpreted or disregarded based on conversational or contextual constraints (consider the difference between what you mean, what you say, and how other people interpret what you say), or to come up with entirely new ideas.
- Liberating Structures are immeasurably practical.

## Goals of Liberating Structures
- To liberate us from the baggage and/or constraints associated with meetings.
  - We all have certain ideas about how business should be conducted - especially in the context of meetings and presentations, or how we interact with superiors, subordinates, and team members in a work environment. These ideas are socialized, learned from social and business culture.
- To engage people
- To contribute for everyone
- To brainstorm
- To speak curiosity and innovation 
- To help us express ourselves outside of these self-imposed constraints. 
  - By design, Liberating Structures distribute control so that participants can shape direction themselves as the action unfolds.
c.f. It does not have to be a project manager to use. 

## Specific examples mentioned in class:
* TRIZ (A problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool derived from the study of patterns of invention in the global patent literature)
* What3 Debrief (What, so what, now what?)
* 1-2-4 Rapid Conversation (One of the most applied facilitation techniques from the Liberating Structure collection)
  - Steps (Resources from [Liberating structure page](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)
    1) Start with 1 minute of silent self-reflection by individuals on a shared challenge, framed as a question;
    2) Take 2 minutes to generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from self-reflection;
    3) Create groups of four and use 4 minutes to share and develop ideas that you’ve discussed within your pair. Notice similarities and differences.
    4) Take 5 minutes to share insights, ideas and takeaways by asking “What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?”. Each group shares one important idea. Repeat cycle as needed.
