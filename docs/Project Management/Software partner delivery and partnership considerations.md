# Software partner delivery and partnership consideration

* Most important: 
- Partner who isn't engaged, don't know what they are working on, bad relationship, don't understand each other, etc. 
### Remember: Build up of everything else we covered.

* Why do we engage them? How do you engage them? 
- Collaboration expectations. 
- Change management is considered. 
- Working agreement. 
- Common definition of done. 
- Ten motivators exercise. 
- Get to know the person, play to those strengths. 

A few things can be taken into considerations.

- Documentation can be used as a back-up .

- Communication is key to keep track of the progress of the project. Know more about your teammates. In case he/she does not communicate well, try to figure out the cause.

- Change Management.

--------------------------
- When dealing with software partners, communication is key. 
- Keep a close working relationship with the product owner, the scrum master and the dev team. 
- The dev team then can react quickly to changing requirements in the project.  
- This is key to agile project management. 
- Another important thing is to keep good documentation of the communications that occur, and of completed work. 
- This can be helpful as a fall back in case issues arise in the project.
