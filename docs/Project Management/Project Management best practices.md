# Project Management best practices. Considerations for establishing project management

From the web source:
1. Understand the project objectives and requirements. 
2. Stable the Scope and Objectives (Milestones). 
3. Define the Deliverables and roles. 
4. Plan commitment to Project Planning, Project Scheduling, Budgeting, and Resource allocation and staffing.
5. Communication.
    - Planning communications management 
    - Managing communications 
    - Controlling communication 
    - Other considerations of communications: 
        - Rarely does the receiver interpret a message exactly as the sender intended 
        - Geographic location and cultural background effect 
        - The complexity of project communication 
6. Tracking and Reporting Project Progress. 
    -  Regular reports and regular meetings of the project team to identify when things are off-target. 
7. Change Management. 
    - ADKAR = a model of individual change: 
    - Awareness | Desire | Knowledge | Ability | Reinforcement 
        - Awareness of the need for change
        - Desire to support the change
        - Knowledge of how to make the change
        - Ability to demonstrate skills & behaviors
        - Reinforcement to make the change stick.
    - The goal of ADKAR is to give each individual the knowledge and tools to be successful in change. 
8. Risk Management. 
    - Make a risk document 
    - Be proactive 
    - Control the future possible events 
    - Systematically identified 
    - Be aware of risks 
    - Categorized risks to a product or to a project 
    - Must deal with as early as possible 

From the textbook:
1. <em> Use an integrated toolbox.</em> Companies that consistently succeed in managing projects clearly define what needs to be done in a project, by whom, when, and how. They use an integrated toolbox, including project management tools, methods, and techniques. They carefully select tools, align them with project and business goals, link them to metrics, and provide them to project managers to deliver positive results.
2. <em> Grow project leaders.</em> The winners know that strong project managers – referred to as project leaders – are crucial to project success. They also know that a good project leader needs to be a business leader as well, with strong inter- and intra- personal skills. Companies that excel in project management often grow or develop their project leaders internally, providing them with career opportunities, training, and mentoring.
3. <em> Develop a streamlined project delivery process.</em> Winning companies have examined every step in the project delivery process, analyzed fluctuations in workloads, searched for ways to reduce variation, and eliminated bottlenecks to create a repeatable delivery process. All projects go through clear stages and clearly defined milestones. All project leaders use a shared road map, focusing on key business aspects of their projects while integrating goals across all parts of the organization.
4. <em> Measure project health using metrics.</em> Companies that excel in project delivery use performance metrics to quantify progress. They focus on a handful of important measurements and apply them to all projects. Metrics often include customer satisfaction, return on investment, and percentage of schedule buffer consumed.

1. Study success. Understand it – don't just copy it.
2. "Continuous improvement" is a philosophy, not just a motivational phrase.
3. Let risk management include assessment of potential opportunities (i.e. positive risks).
4. Consider knowledge derived from data gathered by diverse perspectives and fields. Examples:
- How can finance/marketing-style data modeling be applied to procurement?
- "Behavioral economists know that people do not act rationally." How can we take advantage of this?
- Crowdsourcing ideas from other depts, etc.
5. Managing stakeholders:
- Be clear from the start.
- Explain the consequences.
- Have a contingency plan.
- Avoid surprises (be honest).
- Take a stand.

** Rating these features on a scale from 1-5 (for example) can help us identify entry points. Work through the model in sequence and from weakest to strongest.

** Selecting projects –

SWOT analysis – strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats

** Planning Stages Hierarchy (from fig 4.3, pg. 144)

- Strategy Planning – Tie strategy to mission and vision of organization, Identify key business areas.
- Document key business processes that could benefit from e.g., information technology.
- Define potential projects, scope, benefits, constraints.
- Select projects, assign resources.

** Actually selecting projects
- Focus on broad organizational needs
- Categorize projects
- Perform net present value or other financial analysis (e.g., ROI) – consider opportunity costs.
- Use a weighted scoring model – TL;DR rank potential projects according to quantifiable metrics, choose the best score – a more formal version of the class discussion.
- Implement a balanced scorecard
