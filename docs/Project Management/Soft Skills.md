Unconscious biases are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. They are held beliefs about certain groups of people that may not be immediately known or acted upon: a person who always refers to a male in the group without asking questions of their female coworkers despite their equal knowledge may be unconsciously biased and feel their female coworkers aren't as knowledgeable as their male peers without any ill intent meant. In hiring practices, this can lead to situations such as people assuming confidence equates to knowledge despite different cultures having different opinions about confidence (for example, in some cultures being confident is seen as an unintelligent trait, and those people may be ranked as less intelligent in cultures that value confidence, like the USA).

ADKAR (Awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement)

Make them aware of the problem/why/change, make them desire to change (show them why they would benefit from the change), give them the knowledge they need to make a change, give them the ability to enact the change (knowledge is knowing what it is, ability is enacting that), and reinforcement is rewarding them when they make the change or start acting in the new desirable way.
