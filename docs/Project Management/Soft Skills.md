# Soft Skills

<b>Why hiring for Ideal Team Players is important to companies?</b>

Both parties are investing in each other, so when a company hires a new person they are taking a certain amount of risk based on whether or not that employee with work out. These three traits make it more likely that the investment will pay off for the company doing the hiring.

Understand what motivates people (personal motivators)

<b>Why is 'Drive for Results' so important?</b>

People that drive for results are able to focus on a singular goal and want something to succeed. When someone has a drive for results, this indicates that they are hungry. (Part of the ideal team player)

<b>Why is 'Learning agility' so important?</b>

People with learning agility are able to pick up new skills and apply them quickly, this shows both hungry and smarts, and also allows employers to focus on other skills that a person may not be able to just easily learn or gain. Tech skills can be learned, whereas soft skills cannot. Someone with learning agility can quickly pick up tech and other required learned skills.


<b>What is an unconscious bias?</b>

Unconscious biases are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. They are held beliefs about certain groups of people that may not be immediately known or acted upon: a person who always refers to a male in the group without asking questions of their female coworkers despite their equal knowledge may be unconsciously biased and feel their female coworkers aren't as knowledgeable as their male peers without any ill intent meant. In hiring practices, this can lead to situations such as people assuming confidence equates to knowledge despite different cultures having different opinions about confidence (for example, in some cultures being confident is seen as an unintelligent trait, and those people may be ranked as less intelligent in cultures that value confidence, like the USA).

<b>What did the panel share they do specifically to avoid the bias?</b>

Julie said she created a standardized interview question set to rule out unconscious bias during the interview process.

<b>Why does personal identity impact a person's interaction with team members or change?</b>

People may define their own identity by what they do or did previously, and when asked to change may feel personally attacked; like they are being told part of themselves isn't suited or good enough anymore.

<b>What is Masters of Scale and how does it help John and Conrad keep their skills sharp and grow?</b>

Masters of Scale is a podcast about people who built their own companies and what roadblocks they ran into and how they overcame those problems. They commit to gender balance for guests, so good for them!

The podcast provides information about running and starting a business that help John and Conrad in their own professional lives. Why do you study history? So you don't repeat the past.

In each episode of the podcast they introduce a theory on how successful business scale, and they test the validity of that theory by talking with professionals who have lived through it.

<b>Delighting and personal confidence and how do both help a team?</b>

When you have personal confidence and are personally satisfied and everyone else on the team is also feeling personal sanctification and is confident then the entire team is built up and supported and helped to succeed.



<b>How to help team members when they are not connecting with the team or outcome?</b>

ADKAR (Awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement)

Make them aware of the problem/why/change, make them desire to change (show them why they would benefit from the change), give them the knowledge they need to make a change, give them the ability to enact the change (knowledge is knowing what it is, ability is enacting that), and reinforcement is rewarding them when they make the change or start acting in the new desirable way.

<b>Ideal Team Member</b>

* Hungry: going for internships, being proactive

* Humble: noticeable when someone isn't humble, disconnect between where they feel they should be and where they actually are

* Fine line between hungry and humble: hungry - you need to reach, humble - not so much

* Smart: emotional intelligence, personal motivators. Understanding your role. Passion on the technical side, when interviewing they look for people who have committed free time to working on technical things. Technical knowledge has less weight than soft skills.

* Better than tech: soft skills, character, emotional intelligence, and culturally fit (fitting the team culture)

* Turn adversity and chaos into order.

<b> Fighting unconscious bias </b>

* Putting greater weight on soft skills rather than technical skills.
* Ability to communicate results with nontechnical people is important. 

<b> Dealing with bad team mates </b>

Understand why they are resisting, uncover other motives, (Initial reaction: hire people that aren't like that), empathy training, doing self-abasements, trying to understand the other person's perspective about why they are asking what they are asking, it's better to have motivation within the team rather than having an outside force motivate the team (focus on the same goal as a team). 
If you understand the motivations behind someone asking or doing something then it is less stressful for you as an individual as well.

<b> Attacking a person's identity </b>

* Lessons learned: Initiated dramatic changes and attacks a person's identity because it's attached to a persons' self worth.
To monitor how much change you are trying to initiate: don't completely replace a person's skill set, gradual change.
