# Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the discipline of designing, engineering, and evaluating technology according to human-centered requirements and priorities. Success is measured in factors that directly affect users, such as (human) efficiency, (human) error rates, learnability, memorability, satisfaction, or new capabilities. HCI can be thought of as the intersection between engineering, design, and cognitive psychology. As such, this course will cover a balance of each, as they relate to HCI. Students will learn principles of cognitive psychology and memory that affect what users can (and cannot) achieve, together with design methods, design theory, and how these become a part of the engineering and project management strategies.
