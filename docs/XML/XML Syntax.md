## XML Entity

There are five special symbols that are reserved in XML.
If you use this <b>reserved symbol</b> in an XML document, the XML parser (the interpreting machine) interprets it in a completely different sense.
Therefore, the charset created to use this reserved symbol exactly as it was used is called an entity.

In HTML, many characters and symbols are predefined and used as entities.
However, only five entities are provided by XML.
