# DOM(Document Object Model) 
## What is DOM? 
A W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard for accessing documents or an API to express document(All, HTML, XML) as an object. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
DOM is composed as a <b>tree</b> of Objects.

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

### HTML DOM
The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

## We need DOM to create dynamic document
- To change the content of HTML elements, attributes
- To change the style (CSS) of HTML elements
- To react to all existing HTML DOM events in the page
- To add/delete existing HTML elements and attributes
- To create/remove new HTML events in the page
