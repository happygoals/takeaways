# jQuery
## How to get started with jQuery 
- It is a JavaScript library and it is not a programming language (You might call a Framework). 
- It is a simplified version of JavaScript that allow for people to write JavaScript and websites but in a much more simple way.

## jQuery vs JavaScript
- It is the same programming language, but a different framework. 
- Example of the code comparison 
```ruby 

/*JavaScript*/ 

document.getElementById("test").onclick = function(){
  document.getElementById(this).style.display = 'none';
}

/*jQuery*/ 

$("#test").click(function(){
    $(this).hide(); 
});

```

-> Certain amount of time have passed inside the website 
-> Something has happend inside the website
